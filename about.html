      <h1>Our Mission: A Home Away From Home for Veterans</h1>
      <p>
        At Veteran-BNB, our mission is to provide a welcoming, peaceful, and affordable retreat for veterans and their families. As a retired U.S. Air Force veteran, I created this space to honor those who have served and offer them a place to recharge while enjoying everything Central Florida has to offer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Located in a premium resort just minutes from Disney World and Universal Studios, our 4-bedroom, 3.5-bath townhome is designed with comfort, accessibility, and fun in mind. With resort-style amenities like a lazy river, pools, jacuzzi, arcade, gym, and more, you’ll enjoy a vacation that truly serves you.

      <h2>Why We Exist</h2>
      <p>
        After years of active duty, I realized many vacation properties were not tailored for veterans—especially those with disabilities or larger families. We aim to fix that by offering a home where veterans are treated with dignity, and their families can relax without restrictions.
